# Updated-Portfolio-Page-

[Deployed Portfolio link](https://ekhin.github.io/Updated-Portfolio-Page-/)

## My updated site has the following content:

1. My name
2. Links to my GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as my email address
3. List of projects. For each project I have the following:
    Project title
    Link to the deployed version
    Link to the code on GitHub
4. Mobile-friendliness
5. At least one project should include back end code
6. For each of my projects, I copied the repos to my own GitHub profile since I'm not the owner of the repo. I pulled the latest version of the project from GitHub and changed the origin URL to my repository.
7. At least 5 deployed projects (both of your projects and three homework assignments)
8. Updated my LinkedIn with the projects I've worked on so far
9. Updated the README for each project I linked to with a description of the problem, how I solved it, and some information about my technical approach.
